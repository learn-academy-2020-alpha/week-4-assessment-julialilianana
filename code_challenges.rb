# ASSESSMENT 4: Ruby Coding Practical Questions

# --------------------1) Create a method that takes in an array and returns an array with only odd numbers sorted from least to greatest.

def onlyOdd array
    array.each do |value|
        if typeof value.instance_of ? Fixnum   && value % 2 === 1 || value % 2 === -1
            newArray << value
            newArray.sort
        end
    end

p onlyOdd(fullArr1)




fullArr1 = [4, 9, 0, '7', 8, true, 'hey', 7, 199, -9, false, 'hola']
# Expected output: [-9, 7, 9, 199]
fullArr2 = ['hello', 7, 23, -823, false, 78, nil, '67', 6, 'Number']
# Expected output: [-823, 7, 23]


# --------------------2) Create a class called Bike that is initialized with a model, wheels, and a frame size. The default number of wheels is 2. Create a get_info method that returns a sentence with all the data from the bike object.





# Expected output example: 'The Trek bike has 2 wheels and a 168cm frame.'


# -------------------3) Add a bell to the bike class and create a method that will ring the bell when the method is called.





# Expected output example: my_bike.ring_bell => 'Beep beep!'


# -------------------4) Add a speedometer to the Bike class. The speed should be initialized at 0.





# Expected output example: my_bike.speed => 0


# -------------------5) Add the ability to pedal faster and brake. The pedal_faster method should increase the speed. The brake method should decrease the speed. The bike cannot go negative speeds.





# Expected output example: my_bike.pedal_faster 10 => 10
# Expected output example: my_bike.brake 15 => 0
